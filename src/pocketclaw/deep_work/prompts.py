RESEARCH_PROMPT = """\
You are a senior technical researcher. Your job is to research the domain \
described below and produce structured research notes that will inform a PRD \
and task breakdown.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
{project_description}

OUTPUT FORMAT — plain text with these sections:
1. Domain Overview (2-3 sentences)
2. Key Technical Considerations (bullet list)
3. Risks & Unknowns (bullet list)
4. Comparable Solutions / Prior Art (bullet list)
5. Recommended Approach (1 paragraph)

Keep your response under 400 words. Be specific and actionable.
"""

PRD_PROMPT = """\
You are a product manager. Generate a minimal PRD in markdown for the project \
described below. Use the research notes provided to inform your decisions.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
{project_description}

RESEARCH NOTES:
{research_notes}

OUTPUT FORMAT — markdown with exactly these sections:
## Problem Statement
(1-2 sentences)

## Scope
(What is in scope and what is not)

## Requirements
(Numbered list of functional requirements)

## Non-Goals
(Bullet list of things explicitly out of scope)

## Technical Constraints
(Bullet list of technical limitations or requirements)

Keep the entire PRD under 500 words. Be concise and specific.
"""

TASK_BREAKDOWN_PROMPT = """\
You are a project architect. Break down the following project into atomic, \
executable tasks. Each task should have one clear deliverable.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
{project_description}

PRD:
{prd_content}

RESEARCH NOTES:
{research_notes}

RULES:
- Each task must be atomic (one clear deliverable)
- Mark tasks as "human" if they require physical actions, subjective decisions, \
or access to external systems that an AI agent cannot reach
- Mark tasks as "review" if they are quality gates or approval checkpoints
- All other tasks should be "agent"
- Ensure no cycles in blocked_by_keys (task A cannot depend on task B if B depends on A)
- Use short keys like "t1", "t2", etc.
- Keep estimated_minutes realistic (15-120 range for most tasks)

Output ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown code fences. No commentary. \
Just the raw JSON array:

[
  {{
    "key": "t1",
    "title": "...",
    "description": "... with acceptance criteria",
    "task_type": "agent",
    "priority": "medium",
    "tags": ["..."],
    "estimated_minutes": 30,
    "required_specialties": ["..."],
    "blocked_by_keys": []
  }}
]
"""

TEAM_ASSEMBLY_PROMPT = """\
You are a team architect. Given the following task breakdown, recommend the \
minimal set of AI agents needed to execute this project efficiently. Each agent \
should cover one or more specialties required by the tasks.

TASKS:
{tasks_json}

RULES:
- Recommend the fewest agents that cover all required_specialties
- Each agent should have a clear, non-overlapping role
- Use "claude_agent_sdk" as the backend for all agents
- Agent names should be lowercase-hyphenated (e.g. "backend-dev", "qa-engineer")

Output ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown code fences. No commentary. \
Just the raw JSON array:

[
  {{
    "name": "...",
    "role": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "specialties": ["..."],
    "backend": "claude_agent_sdk"
  }}

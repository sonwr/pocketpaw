# Why PocketPaw?

There are many AI assistants and agent frameworks available today. Here's what makes PocketPaw different.

## Self-Hosted, Not Cloud-Dependent

PocketPaw runs **entirely on your machine**. Your conversations, files, and data never leave your control. There's no cloud service to subscribe to, no usage limits imposed by a platform, and no risk of a provider shutting down your access.

| Feature | PocketPaw | Cloud AI Assistants |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Data location | Your machine | Provider's servers |
| Privacy | Full control | Provider's policy |
| Uptime | You control | Provider controls |
| Customization | Unlimited | Limited |
| Cost | API costs only | Subscription + API |

## Multi-Channel by Default

Most AI tools work in a single interface. PocketPaw connects to **9+ messaging platforms simultaneously**:

- **Telegram** — Full bot API with topic support
- **Discord** — Slash commands, DM, and mention support
- **Slack** — Socket Mode (no public URL needed)
- **WhatsApp** — Business API or Personal mode via QR scan
- **Signal** — Privacy-focused messaging
- **Matrix** — Decentralized, federated protocol
- **Microsoft Teams** — Enterprise collaboration
- **Google Chat** — Workspace integration
- **Web Dashboard** — Built-in real-time interface

You can run all of them at once. Send a message from Telegram, continue the conversation from Discord, and monitor everything from the web dashboard.

## Six Agent Backends

PocketPaw doesn't lock you into a single AI provider or execution model:

| Backend | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Claude Agent SDK** (default) | Anthropic's official SDK with built-in tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit). Best for coding and complex reasoning. |
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | OpenAI's agent framework with GPT models. Supports Ollama for local inference. |
| **Google ADK** | Google Agent Development Kit with Gemini models and native MCP support. |
| **Codex CLI** | OpenAI's Codex CLI for code-focused tasks with MCP support. |
| **OpenCode** | External server-based backend via REST API. |
| **Copilot SDK** | GitHub Copilot SDK with multi-provider support (Copilot, OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic). |

Switch backends anytime in Settings or via the `POCKETPAW_AGENT_BACKEND` environment variable.

## Extensible Tool System

PocketPaw ships with 50+ built-in tools and supports custom tool creation:

- **Web Search** — Tavily and Brave Search providers
- **Image Generation** — Google Gemini models
- **Voice & TTS** — OpenAI and ElevenLabs
- **Speech to Text** — OpenAI Whisper
- **Browser Automation** — Playwright with accessibility tree
- **OCR** — GPT-4o Vision with pytesseract fallback
- **Research** — Multi-step web research chains
- **Delegation** — Spawn sub-agents for parallel work
- **Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs** — Full Google Workspace
- **Spotify** — Search, playback control, playlists
- **Reddit** — Search, read threads, trending content
- **MCP Servers** — Connect any Model Context Protocol server

Tools are governed by a **policy system** with profiles (minimal, coding, full) and per-tool allow/deny lists.

## Security Built In

PocketPaw takes security seriously with seven independent defense layers:

1. **Credential Encryption** — Fernet AES-128 with machine-derived key
2. **Session Authentication** — WebSocket token + per-channel allowlists
3. **Rate Limiting** — Configurable per-channel throttle
4. **Injection Scanner** — Two-tier detection (regex + LLM) for prompt injection
5. **Tool Policy Engine** — Per-tool allow/deny with profiles
6. **Command Blocking** — Dangerous shell command interception
7. **Guardian AI** — Secondary LLM safety review before execution

## Modular Installation

PocketPaw's core is lightweight (~10 packages). Everything else is an optional extra:

```bash
# One-line install
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh

# Or with pip — pick your extras
pip install pocketpaw[telegram,discord,slack]
pip install pocketpaw[all-tools]
pip install pocketpaw[all]
```

You only install what you actually use. No bloated dependencies.

## Open Source

PocketPaw is fully open source. You can inspect every line of code, contribute improvements, and fork it to build your own agent. No black boxes, no proprietary lock-in.
